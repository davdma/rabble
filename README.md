# CS 220 Homework: Rabble Web Application

This repository contains the code for a simple Reddit-like web application I wrote in Django
for [CMSC 22000 - Introduction to Software Development](https://uchicago-cs.github.io/cmsc22000/)
at the University of Chicago.

The web application was subsequently deployed to Google Cloud server at https://rabble-davidma.uc.r.appspot.com/ (if the link no longer works, the deployment has been shut down).
